## Business Objective

This project analyzes the Netflix content catalog to provide a strategic overview for business executives. The key objectives were to:

* Understand the historical and current mix of movies versus TV shows.
* Identify the primary genres and maturity ratings that define the platform.
* Visualize the geographic footprint of Netflix's content production.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

The analysis revealed several key trends in Netflix's content strategy:

* **Aggressive Pivot to TV Shows:** While movies still make up over 68% of the total library, the yearly distribution chart shows a massive acceleration in TV show acquisition and production starting around 2016, indicating a strategic shift towards subscriber-retaining series.

* **Focus on Niche & Factual Content:** Contrary to popular belief, **Documentaries** and **Stand-Up Comedy** are the top two genres. This suggests a strategy focused on attracting diverse audiences through high-value, non-fiction content.

* **Targeting Mature Audiences:** The content is heavily skewed towards mature viewers, with **TV-MA** being the most common rating by a significant marginâ€”more than double the next category (TV-14).
